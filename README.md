# MAC Address Changer

A Python script to change the MAC address of a specified network interface. This tool can be used for various purposes such as network testing, privacy enhancement, or device impersonation.

## Features

- **Change MAC address**: Easily change the MAC address of your network interface.
- **Bypass network filters**: Modify your MAC address to bypass MAC-based filters or restrictions in networks.
- **Device impersonation**: Spoof another device by setting its MAC address.
- **Privacy enhancement**: Change your MAC address to protect your privacy and avoid tracking based on your network interface.
- **Cross-platform**: The script works on Linux and macOS, but Windows requires modification.

## Prerequisites

Before using the script, make sure you have the following:

- **Python**: Ensure you have Python 2.7 or 3.x installed.
- **Administrator/Sudo Privileges**: Changing MAC addresses requires elevated privileges.
- **Linux or macOS**: The script uses `ifconfig`, which is available on Unix-like systems. On Windows, the script would need modifications to use `netsh` or similar tools.

## Installation

### Clone the repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/Esammansour883/mac-address-changer.git
 cd mac-address-changer
 ```

### Install Dependencies

This script uses Pythonâ€™s subprocess, argparse, and re libraries, which are available by default in Python.

No external dependencies need to be installed, but ensure you have Python installed on your system.

## Usage

To change the MAC address of a network interface, run the script with the following command:

 ```bash
 python chang_mac_address.py -i <interface> -m <new_mac>
 ```

Where:
- **<interface>**: The network interface (e.g., eth0, wlan0, etc.).
- **<new_mac>**: The new MAC address in the format XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX.

### Example:

 ```bash
 python chang_mac_address.py -i eth0 -m 00:55:77:44:77:88
 ```

### Script Output

- **Success**: If the MAC address is successfully changed, you will see a message like:

```bash
 [+] Changing MAC address for eth0...
 [+] The MAC address has been successfully changed to 00:55:77:44:77:88
 ```

- **Failure**: If an error occurs, an appropriate error message will be displayed:

 ```bash
 [-] Failed to change MAC address. Check your permissions or inputs.
 ```

## How It Works

- The script first checks whether the provided MAC address has a valid format using regular expressions.
- It then verifies that the specified network interface exists on the system.
- The script uses the ifconfig tool to disable the interface, change the MAC address, and then bring the interface back up.
- After the operation, it checks if the MAC address was successfully updated by inspecting the output of ifconfig.

## Enhancements and Use Cases

- **Privacy**: Frequently changing your MAC address can enhance privacy, especially in public Wi-Fi networks.
- **Network Testing**: Useful for network administrators or testers to simulate different devices or bypass network restrictions.
- **Device Impersonation**: You can impersonate another device by setting its MAC address, useful for testing network behavior.

## Limitations

- **Windows Compatibility**: This script uses ifconfig, which is not available on Windows. To make it work on Windows, you would need to modify the script to use Windows-specific commands like netsh.
- **Network Adapter Support**: Not all network adapters support changing the MAC address, especially on virtual machines or certain hardware.
